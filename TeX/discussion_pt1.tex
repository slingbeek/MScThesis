\begin{itemize}
    \item the $T_2$ temperature is limited as a metric when temperatures are not uniform, in CAM the warming hole over the Northern Atlantic leads to warming over the Arctic, zonal mean temperatures show large variation in temperature over the Northern Hemisphere, but $T_2$ is still stable.
    \item comparing precipitation between two models that exhibit vastly different behaviour for precipitation is unreliable. CAM is wetter than WACCM in ITCZ region, but dryer in other outside of tropics. Even more so in Control and SAI 2020, with CAM showing a much larger increase in the tropics in both scenarios.  
    \item coarse horizontal resolution leads to not so reliable results for precipitation (Ren\'e zei dit, moet ik nog verder naar kijken)
    \item thick layers in upper stratosphere in WACCM (CMIP6) make validation harder
    \item over equator upper stratosphere differences between models remain unexplained
    \item all of the above is exacerbated by the limited data that comes with using only one run for each scenario in each model
\end{itemize}
