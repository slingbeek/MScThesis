\begin{itemize}
    \item application of emulator to SAI 2080 scenario flawed, cooling from a different state than scenario emulator was built off leads to over- and undercooling
    \item any interannual variability is not examined, only 20-year climatology
    \item building on that: only one model run so any conclusions are limited
    \item monthly data limits insights into SSW's, other limitations too
\end{itemize}
