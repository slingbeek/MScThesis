First of all I would like to thank my supervisors Claudia Wieners, Michiel Baatsen and Jasper de Jong for their guidance, wisdom and understanding, and the weekly meetings that were as fun as they were productive. In particular Claudia for sharing her expertise on geoengineering and guiding me through the process of doing research, Michiel for sharing his seemingly endless knowledge on the atmosphere, and Jasper for helping me with the numerous technical and practical issues I encountered along the way.

I would also like to thank Daniel Pfl\"uger for the use of his dataset and helping met get started with my analysis of it, and for the comradery among activists at IMAU. 

I want to thank Willem for his support and care, helping me get through these past months. And lastly thanks to my friends and family for their support and encouragement and my fellow students for the warm atmosphere in the IMAU Master's room.
